## Use automations to connect your plugins ##

Here are some automations samples to give you a quick idea of the possible combinations:

When user purchases a **WooCommerce product**.
Add a **WP Fusion tag** to the user.

When user joins a **BuddyPress group**.
Enroll user in a **LearnDash course**.

Not only you can create one-to-one connections, also you can create automations with all the triggers and actions you want, such as the following one:

When user creates a **bbPress forum topic**
and completes a **H5P content**.

Enroll user in a **LifterLMS course**
add a **MemberPress membership** to the user
and **email user** with instructions about how to access to the course.

The number of combinations and possibilities are unlimited!

## Connect your plugins with web services and others WordPress sites ##

With the [Webhooks](https://automatorwp.com/add-ons/webhooks/)  add-on you are able to send and receive data from anywhere like external applications, web services or others WordPress sites.

You can connect all your WordPress plugins with platforms like Zapier or Integromat, even you can connect your plugins from a site with the plugins of another site and everything with no code.

Any website, application or service with support to webhooks or with a Rest API can be connected with the Webhooks add-on and, in consequence, with your WordPress plugins!
